Expect to find a mishmash of scripts, pipelines, possibly a half-baked CI/CD pipeline that no one asked for, or probably a YAML file that’s plotting to take over the world—don’t worry, possibly a half-baked CI/CD pipeline that no one asked for, but here we are. I’m as confused as you are. If not, maybe you are at the wrong place at the right time. Contribute if you dare, or just watch as DevOps chaos unfolds in real-time!
